# Health Store App

This app enables a user to purchase exercise equipment and health supplements. The user can select products on the catalogue page and keep track of the items by viewing the cart page that updates in real time. The cart page also monitors the cost of all the products added to the cart. The user can increase or decrease the quantity of each item or remove the item completely by deleting it. Each modification in the cart is reflected in the total cost of the cart in the user interface. Details of the cart are stored in the session storage of the browser. The app was built using HTML, CSS and javaScript.
