# Health Store App

The app serves as a health store that allows a user to purchase exercise equipment and health supplements. The user can select products on the catalogue page and keep track of them by viewing the cart page. The cart page also monitors the cost of all the products added. The user can increase or decrease the quantity of each item or remove the item completely by deleting it. Each modification in the cart is reflected in the total cost of the cart. The details for the cart are stored in the storage of the browser.
