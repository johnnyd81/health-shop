# The GOQ Studio
 
My project is an online shopping app that allows a user to select items from 
a catalogue page and see their purchases on a shopping cart page. It also simulates commercial activities like 
discount coupons and the delivery of the products.

* The screenshot above shows the catalogue page that allows the user to select the products that they want. Each product has an add to cart
button that makes it easy for a user to select. Each click on the add to cart button calculates the amount of products selected.

* The discount form above gives the user the opportunity to receive a discount. The discount is reliant on the amount of items purchased. Just below it 
are options for delivery of the products purchased. The red button is the final step that confirms the order.
